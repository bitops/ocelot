README
======

A small ```cat```  implementation I'm doing just for fun. Won't be big and professional like GNU.

```shell
Performance:
test file: /usr/share/dict/words

ocelot's time:
real	0m1.069s
user	0m0.558s
sys	0m0.370s

cat's     time:
real	0m0.395s
user	0m0.001s
sys	0m0.062s
```

INSPIRATION
===========
I was inspired to try writing this program after reading these articles:

[Building Unix-style command line applications](https://practicingruby.com/articles/building-unix-style-command-line-applications)

[TLDP: Process Substitution](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/process-sub.html)

[Writing Ruby Scripts That Respect Pipelines](http://www.jstorimer.com/blogs/workingwithcode/7766125-writing-ruby-scripts-that-respect-pipelines)
