A small ```cat```  implementation I'm doing just for fun. Won't be big and professional like GNU.

```shell
Performance:
test file: /usr/share/dict/words

ocelot's time:
real    0m0.719s
user    0m0.036s
sys     0m0.060s

cat's     time:
real    0m0.679s
user    0m0.002s
sys     0m0.052s
```

INSPIRATION
===========
I was inspired to try writing this program after reading these articles:

[Building Unix-style command line applications](https://practicingruby.com/articles/building-unix-style-command-line-applications)

[TLDP: Process Substitution](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/process-sub.html)

[Writing Ruby Scripts That Respect Pipelines](http://www.jstorimer.com/blogs/workingwithcode/7766125-writing-ruby-scripts-that-respect-pipelines)
